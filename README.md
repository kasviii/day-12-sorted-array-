What the code does:

It asks you to enter a list of numbers, like 0s, 1s, and 2s, separated by spaces.
It sorts the numbers in ascending order (from smallest to largest), so all the 0s come first, then the 1s, and then the 2s.
It prints out the sorted list so you can see the results.
How to run the code:

Using the code:

Enter numbers: The code will ask you to "Enter the numbers in the array, separated by spaces: ".
Type your list: Type the numbers you want to sort, separated by spaces, and press Enter. For example, you could type "2 0 1 1 2 0".
See the result: The code will print "The sorted array is:", followed by the list of numbers in sorted order.
